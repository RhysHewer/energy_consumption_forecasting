Visualising and forecasting electricity consumption

**Goal**: visualise electricity consumption in a household and forecast future consumption.  
**Dataset**: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption  archive containing 2075259 measurements gathered in a house located in Sceaux (7km of Paris, France) between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months). 

**Files**:  
*libraries.R*: library script.  
*dataprocessing.R*: data preprocessing and feature engineering.
*trendForecast.R*: forecasting energy consumption trend for following 6 months.  
*energySpending.R*: 14 day energy costs & visualisation.  
*energyUse.R*: visualise differences in energy consumption summer v winter.  
*quarterForecast.R*: Forecasting energy consumption to end of current quarter/next quarter.  
*energyConsumptionPresentation.pdf*: presentation of finalised project.
